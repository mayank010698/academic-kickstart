I am a final year undergraduate in the department of Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Broadly, my field of interest include Machine Learning, Information Theory and Signal Processing. In the past, I have worked with Dr.Vipul Arora on unsupervised generation of lattices in LQCD using Variational AutoEncoders. As an intern in the Automatic Speech Recgnition team at Samsung Electronics,South Korea I worked on implementation of unsupervised voice gender conversion using VAEs.

Apart from these I have done courses on Information Theory,Signal Processing,Bayesian Learning and Convex Optimisation. I am currenlty looking for summer internships.
