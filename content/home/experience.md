  Towards Meaningful Physics from Generative Models 

  * Generated lattice samples for LQCD data using Hybrid Monte Carlo techniques.
  * Implemented various VAE architecture to learn a generative model in Pytorch
  * Implemented H/G VAE model to produce a separation in the latent space based on KT transition temperature.

  Data Augmentation using Generative Modelling:
  
  * Implemented a Conditional Variational Auto encoder (CVAE) for speech data augmentation by converting speakers.
  * Generated voice from speakers of existing DB to different speakers by VAE, and utilized them as an additional training DB.
  * Nearly doubled the size of training dataset by augmentation.
  * Incorporated the VAE model with Automatic Speech Recognition pipeline.
  * Increased the accuracy of baseline model trained from limited DB upto 90 percent (2 percent increase).
